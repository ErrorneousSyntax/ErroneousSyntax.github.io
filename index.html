        <h1>Dimensionality Reduction in Clustering</h1>
        <p>
            In data science, we often attempt to find insights from big data, looking for
            hidden patterns and relationships. However, with datasets containing more than 3 
            features, one must consider a graph of high-dimensions (such as a graph with 100 Dimensionality).
            However the human mind simply cannot comprehend this, yet so visualising this sort
            of data is becoming increasingly important.
