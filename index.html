        <h1>Dimensionality Reduction in Clustering</h1>
        <p>
            In data science, we often attempt to find insights from big data, looking for
            hidden patterns and relationships. However, with datasets containing more than 3 
            features, one must consider a graph of high-dimensions (such as a graph with 100 Dimensionality).
            However the human mind simply cannot comprehend this, yet so visualising this sort
            of data is becoming increasingly important.

        <p>
            To attempt to understand why dimentionality reduction to find clusters is important, 
            we shall start with a simple 3d graph with artificial clusters. (Note that it is easy
            to identify clusters in low Dimensionality as seen here, but is impossible beyond 4 dimensions.)
